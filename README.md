# MPU6050 FlightSoftware

In this Repo I will upload my MPU6050 Code if anyone  wants to use it. I will try make it better and if you wish to make it better check Contributing section.   


## How to use?

Just copy the code or download the zip file and you can test it in VScode using Platform.io extension. 


If you wanna use it in Arduino IDE then copy the code, put it in your Arduino file and you would be ready to go.

Of coure you shold be having a microcontroller and MPU5060 itself !!


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcomed. Actually not welcomed but needed cause I am nothing more than just a nerd who barely knows to code.

So, feel free to Contribute and help.
